# Face_mask_and_social_distancing
Software made to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not and displays probability percentage.
It also automatically creates a log of the time a face was detected and it's status (was wearing a mask or not)
It utilizes the centroid tracking algorithm to minimize the number of times a unique face has to be detected, making it computationally fast.
To run this code, simply go to your python terminal and type " python final.py" 
You should have a video file in the same directory called "video.mp4" to make this work
Video name and extension and almost everything else can be changed within the code
